legacy = []
# Enables compilation of some older algorithms: md2 (hash), rc5 (block cypher) and enabled use of
# some weaker algorithms in SSL connections. These are generally not recommended for use.

# Enables compilation of the Camellia symmetric key block cypher. Since hardware acceleration for

# Enables compilation of International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA), a symmetric key block
